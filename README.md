# Scramble
Scrambles all the text on a page. Only scrambles the middle letters so it's still kind of readable but not really.

[Install with tampermonkey](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/22121-scrambler) if you want if to load on every page.

### Issues
HTML entities might mess up the scramble and make it show a bunch of random text. Only accounted for nbsp since it's the most common.
